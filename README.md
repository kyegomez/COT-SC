# Chain of Thought with Self-Consistency


Chain of Thought with Self-Consistency is an unsupervised method for improving the reasoning capabilities of pre-trained language models. It leverages diverse reasoning paths to find the most consistent answer, resulting in improved performance on arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chain-of-thought-self-consistency.git
cd COT-SC
```

## Architectural Overview
Prompt a language model using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. [we can use meta agent to improve the chain of thoughts prompt ]

Sample from the language model's decoder to generate a diverse set of reasoning paths.

Marginalize out the reasoning paths and aggregate by choosing the most consistent answer in the final answer set.



# Algorithmic Pseudocode
```
function self_consistency(prompt, question, language_model, num_samples):
    sampled_outputs = sample_outputs(prompt, question, language_model, num_samples)
    aggregated_answers = aggregate_answers(sampled_outputs)
    most_consistent_answer = find_most_consistent_answer(aggregated_answers)
    return most_consistent_answer

```
